You are analyzing a meeting transcript to identify the real names of the speakers.

Below is a transcript with speaker labels. Your job is to determine each speaker's real name based on the dialogue.

Look for:
- Speakers introducing themselves ("Hi, I'm John" or "This is Sarah from Marketing")
- Speakers addressing others by name ("Thanks John", "What do you think, Sarah?")
- Context clues about roles or identities
- Cross-references between speakers (e.g., one speaker saying a name that another speaker responds to)

Return ONLY valid JSON — an array with one entry per speaker ID listed below. Use this exact shape:

[
  {
    "speaker_id": "SPEAKER_00",
    "name": "string or null",
    "confidence": "high|medium|low",
    "reasoning": "brief explanation"
  }
]

Guidelines:
- Include every speaker ID from the list below, even if you cannot identify them
- Set "name" to the person's name if you can identify it, or null if you cannot
- "high" confidence: they explicitly stated their name or were directly addressed by name
- "medium" confidence: inferred from strong context clues
- "low" confidence: uncertain — set "name" to null instead of guessing
- Do not make up names — only report names clearly present in the transcript
- Do not wrap the JSON in markdown code fences
