You are analyzing a meeting transcript to identify who a speaker is.

Below is a sample of what this speaker said during the meeting. Based on their dialogue, try to determine their name.

IMPORTANT: Only provide a name if you are confident. Look for:
- The speaker introducing themselves ("Hi, I'm John" or "This is Sarah from Marketing")
- Others addressing them by name ("Thanks John" or "What do you think, Sarah?")
- Context clues about their role that might reveal their name

Return ONLY valid JSON with this exact shape:
{
  "name": "string|null",
  "confidence": "high|medium|low",
  "reasoning": "string"
}

Guidelines:
- Set "name" to the person's name if you can identify it, or null if you cannot
- Set "confidence" to:
  - "high" if they explicitly stated their name or were directly addressed by name
  - "medium" if you inferred it from context clues
  - "low" if it's a guess or uncertain
- If confidence would be "low" and you're not sure, set "name" to null instead
- "reasoning" should briefly explain how you identified the name (or why you couldn't)
- Do not wrap the JSON in markdown code fences
- Do not make up names - only report names that are clearly mentioned
